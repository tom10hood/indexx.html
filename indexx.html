            <p>For now just a table with the data bound to the rows (tr). It will not display anything, but check the elements tab to be sure that it created them.  I have an example, empty table below.</p>

        <h1>Something Extra?</h1>
        <p>You've got a lot of leeway here.  Adding CSS to stlye this page wouldget you a 9, but to get a 10 you will need to come up with something to demonstrate deeper understanding of d3.</p>
